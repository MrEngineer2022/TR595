This is an alternative to ARKY's TR-595 TOP PANEL PCB Design.
I have modified the TOP PANEL PCB via the EAGLE PCB software.
This modification allows you to have a 4-LED sequence from left to right
However, this board is not tested yet but I have exorted the files into Gerber format where an online PCB site checks out.
ALso, since I do not have a 3D printer, I cannot confirm if the LED placements are correct.
This design was based on ARKY's original Gerber Files created from the Fusion 360.
This was the source I used to get the placement of the LEDs.
The circuit allows you to either use the clock source from  the on-board 555 timer or tap the signal from the FRONT ARRAY PCB.
This is achieved via soldering the link on the SMD jumper JMP1.
Also, I have added a rough notes in case you need to change the four 0805 LEDs to other colours.
